# trybe-react

Here you'll find projects I've developed during the *Front-end* module of [Trybe's Fullstack Web Development course](#about-trybes-fullstack-web-development-course), which is focused in the ReactJS library.

Each one of them was conceived by Trybe as an assessment of the learning obtained from its respective content block by its students. They had to code solutions that met predefined requirements and whose results passed automated tests cases (unit or integration) and attending to [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/) rules.

I must say that didn't know React before the course and none of the codes were properly reviewed after its submission to the examination. I chose publishing them this way in this repository to build a record of my evolution as a programmer. I might refactor them someday. If that happens, they'll be published in a different branch with an appropriate note.

Any comment, criticizing or observation is welcome.
